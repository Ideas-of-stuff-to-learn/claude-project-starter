# <Project Name> — AI Operating Instructions

_One paragraph describing what this project does, its tech stack, and its primary purpose. Replace this placeholder._

## Persistent Knowledge System

This repository uses a persistent intelligence system. Do not reconstruct project understanding from scratch by scanning the whole repo — use the knowledge system instead.

### Keep the Context Window Light

Query SQLite for exactly what the current task needs — do not load everything upfront, and do not accumulate knowledge in the context window just because it is convenient. This applies continuously throughout every session, not only at the start.

### Entry Point

**SQLite database:** `.ai/knowledge.db`

Query it to find what you need:
```sql
-- Recover project context (start here in any new session)
SELECT * FROM realignment WHERE id = 1;

-- Find context docs by topic
SELECT name, path, description FROM context_documents WHERE tags LIKE '%auth%';

-- Find key files by area
SELECT path, description FROM files WHERE tags LIKE '%categorization%';

-- Find what depends on a file
SELECT * FROM dependencies WHERE target LIKE '%pipeline%';

-- Check constraints before modifying anything
SELECT title, description FROM constraints WHERE severity = 'hard';

-- Check if approach has been tried and failed
SELECT title, lesson FROM failed_solutions WHERE area = 'web';
```

### Context Documents (`context/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `context/realignment.md` | **Start here** — recovery map, what to load and in what order |
| `context/overview.md` | Project purpose, subsystems, tech stack |
| `context/architecture.md` | Layers, data flows, component responsibilities |
| `context/constraints.md` | Hard invariants that must not be violated |
| `context/current-task.md` | Active task, recent state |
| `context/dependencies.md` | File-to-file dependencies, call chains |
| `context/decisions.md` | Engineering decisions with rationale |
| `context/known-problems.md` | Known bugs, debt, fragile areas |
| `context/failed-solutions.md` | Previously attempted approaches that failed |
| `context/verification.md` | Build, dev server, and manual verification procedures |
| `context/handoff.md` | Recent changes, open work, notes for next session |
| `context/gitContext.md` | Git repo URL, workflow rules, CI/CD |

**Do NOT read** `context/overview.html` unless explicitly told to. It is a client/developer-facing progress report, not AI engineering context.

## Context Degradation Recovery

If you are in a new session, have lost context, are unsure about architecture, or are continuing work from another session:

1. Read `context/realignment.md` — it tells you exactly what to load and in what order
2. Query `.ai/knowledge.db` realignment record for pointers
3. Do NOT scan the entire repository — retrieve only what you need for the task

## Updating Durable Knowledge

When you discover something that should persist:

| Discovery | Update |
|---|---|
| Architecture finding | `context/architecture.md` |
| New dependency relationship | `context/dependencies.md` |
| Design decision | `context/decisions.md` |
| Hard constraint | `context/constraints.md` |
| New bug or debt | `context/known-problems.md` |
| Failed approach | `context/failed-solutions.md` |
| Active task state | `context/current-task.md` |
| Session state / recent changes | `context/handoff.md` |
| Intelligence system usage | `context/savings-log.md` |
| Revert safe-points | `context/revert-state.md` |

**Ghost test / local verification cleanup:** any temporary files generated during a ghost test or local verification (scratch scripts, test outputs, debug files) must be fully deleted before the task is considered complete. Never commit or leave them in the working directory.

**Before touching any code**, record the current commit hash in `context/revert-state.md`:
```bash
git rev-parse HEAD  # copy this hash into the log
```
Format: `YYYY-MM-DD | task: <description> | safe-point: <hash> | status: in-progress`
Update status to `complete` or `reverted` when done.
If changes are still local: `git reset --hard <hash>`. If already pushed: `git revert <hash>`.

At the end of every session, append one line to `context/savings-log.md`:
```
YYYY-MM-DD | task: <what was done> | SQLite queries: <N> | context docs loaded: <N> | full repo scan avoided: yes/no | notes
```

After updating Markdown, sync to SQLite:
```bash
python .ai/sync_context.py   # fast — only re-syncs changed context/*.md docs
python .ai/rebuild_db.py     # full rebuild — use when file index/deps/constraints change
```

## Overview.html Update Rule

`context/overview.html` is developer/client-facing and follows a milestone structure: a sidebar table of contents, a "Since the last major change" section at the top for incremental work, and older content grouped under "Major change" sections below it, newest first. Small refinements get added to the top section instead of editing older milestone text.

When a change is substantial enough to count as its own milestone: promote the existing "Since the last major change" section in place — relabel it "Major change: \<description\>", move it down above the previous top-most "Major change" section (newest-first order), and update its anchor/TOC entry. Then open a new empty "Since the last major change" section at the top. Never create a second parallel section and copy content into it.

---

## Enforcement Rules

These rules are non-negotiable and apply to every task, every session:

1. **Give rolling status after every chunk within a task.** After each meaningful sub-step (file edited, command run, decision made), output a visible status line:
   ```
   ✓ <what was just done> [~X% complete]
   → <what's next> [~X% complete]
   ```
   Do not go silent between tool calls. The percentage is a rough pulse, not a precise figure.

2. **Emit a task-complete summary when a task finishes.** Run `python .claude/hooks/task_complete_stats.py` and include the output in your reply. The summary must show: files changed, % of codebase affected, git diff line count, any critical areas touched, and a one-line opinion on scope/risk. If the script fails, emit this inline.

3. **Run `/task-done` after every completed subtask.** Any time you finish a discrete piece of work and report it to the user, run `/task-done` first. This records the safe-point, updates the backlog and current-task, updates relevant context files, and syncs the DB. Never skip it just because the task feels small.

4. **Run `/verifier` before declaring a task complete.** If the task touched source code (not just context docs), the verifier must pass before you tell the user it is done. If `/verifier` fails, fix the issue or surface it explicitly — never report "done" over a failing verifier.

5. **Never push without an explicit "ship" from the user.** Commits are fine at any point; pushing to any remote requires the user to say "ship", "ship to main", or "ship to branch". These are manual-only skills (`/ship-main`, `/ship-branch`) — do not invoke them automatically.

---

## Git Workflow

- **Trigger word:** `"ship"` — when the owner says this, commit and push current work
- Direct to `main` by default (no PR unless owner requests one)
- Never auto-merge
- Branch workflow (`ai/<desc>`) only when owner explicitly requests a PR; after merge: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
- `git pull --rebase` before pushing if behind origin; `git stash -u` first if uncommitted changes exist
- Commit attribution: end all commit messages with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Bot commits (`Backup log:`, `Keep-alive ping:`) appear in git log — ignore them
- Full git workflow stored in SQLite: `SELECT workflow, notes FROM git_configuration WHERE id = 1;`

---

## Progress Updates

After each meaningful sub-step of any task — reading context, finishing a file edit, completing a sync, hitting a decision point — write a one-to-two line **visible text message to the user** with a rough overall completion percentage. This must appear as actual chat text the user can read, not as a tool call description or internal label.

```
✓ <what was just done> [~X% complete]
→ <what's next / current step> [~X% complete]
```

- Write these as plain text in the response, before or after tool calls, so the user sees them in the chat UI
- Applies to every task, small or large, including when just reading files or querying SQLite
- Percentage is a rough pulse, not a precise figure; reset or note if scope expands
- Do not front-load a full plan and then go silent — give updates as work progresses
- **For large tasks**: two levels — granular sub-step updates within each phase, **plus** a one-to-two line chunk-complete summary when a major phase finishes (e.g. "✓ Backend changes complete — all 3 files updated [~50%]")

## Hard Constraints (Quick Reference)

_Add project-specific hard constraints here. Examples:_
- **Never hand-edit** generated config files (list them)
- **Sentinel constants** that must stay in sync across multiple files
- **Files that must never be read** (large generated files, secrets)
- **External API version pins** to check before touching integrations
